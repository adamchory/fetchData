# Fetching Data Exercise
This application uses React to fetch, manipulate, and render data from an external source. This specific application pulls data from Hacker News and renders it on a centralized page, allowing the user to easily maneuver through headlines, and page through older data.

## How to Run?
Download the files to a local folder and run using http-server.

## Roadmap of Future Impovements
I would like to adapt this application to render basketball statistics based on the user's desired team. Using the balldontlie API, we have centralized and organized data that we can render into our application. Adding player cards with statistics would allow for a clean UI, while paging through the data can switch from player to player, much as this application pages through headlines from Hacker News.
